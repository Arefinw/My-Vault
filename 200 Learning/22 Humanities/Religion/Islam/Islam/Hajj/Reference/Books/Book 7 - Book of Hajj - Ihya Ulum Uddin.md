## Introduction
To go further: it is a well-known fact that the greater pilgrimage (Hajj) is one of the fundamental principles of Islam: it is the lifetime worship, the conclusion of the commands (and orders of Allah Almighty), the perfection of faith in Islam, and the completion of religion.

Pertaining to it, the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" said (according to the narration of Ibn Abd on the authority of Abu Hurairah): *"He, who dies without performing Hajj (even though he has the power and ability to do it, his Islam will have not complete, and then it is the same to him) to die as a Jew if he so likes, or as a Christian if he so likes."*

*Structure of this book:*
1. The first chapter pertains to the good merits of the greater pilgrimage (Hajj), the excellence of Mecca and the Ancient House, as well as the pillars and conditions of its obligation. 
2. The second chapter deals with its outward works in order, beginning from setting out on journey (to perform Hajj) ending with the return. 
3. The third chapter discusses its fine proprieties, and abstruse mysteries, and inward works.


## Chapter One: On The Good Merits Of The Greater Pilgrimage (Hajj), The Excellence of Mecca And the  Ancient House, And the Pillars And Conditions of its Obligation.

This chapter is divided into <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">two</mark> parts:
1. The Excellence Of The Greater Pilgrimage (Hajj), and The Merit Of The House And Mecca.
2. The conditions of the obligation of greater pilgrimage; the validity of its pillars; its duties and taboos

### Part One: The Excellence Of The Greater Pilgrimage (Hajj), and The Merit Of The House And Mecca.
#### The Excellence Of The Greater Pilgrimage (Hajj).
the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" further said (according to the narration of Malik on the authority of Talhah Ibn Abdullah): "Satan is never seen on a day, more trivial, more despised, more scorned, and more vexed than he is on the day of Arafah (i.e. the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah, on which standing in Arafah constitutes the fundamental pillar of Hajj)." This is only because of the great mercy which Allah Almighty sends upon His servants in abundance, and the prolific number of great sins which Allah Almighty plots of His servants, depending upon the statement that "*from amongst the sins, there are such grave as nothing plots out other than the stay on the day of Arafah.*"

What happens to Satan during Arafah:
1. weeps because the people set out with the sole intention to perform Hajj with no purpose of practicing traffic, thereupon I say (to myself) that they aim at it only, I feel afraid they might not be disappointed.
2. becomes lean because of the horses' neighing in the Cause of Allah, and had it been for my cause, it would have been more joyful to me.
3. becomes pale because of the group's co-operation in obedience (of Allah), and had they co­ operated in disobedience (of Allah) it would have been dearer to me.
4. back gets broken because of the saying of the servant: "O Allah! I ask you the good conclusion (of my deeds)".

The Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" said (according to both Sahihs on the authority of Abu Hurairah): "The performance of Hajj that is accepted (by Allah Almighty, and this requires both conditions of sincerity and conformity with the law) is much better than this world and all of what it contains; and the Hajj which is accepted (by Allah Almighty) has no reward but the Garden."

According to another tradition (narrated by Al-Khatib on the authority of Ibn Umar) transmitted from the family of the Prophet: "Such as has the greatest sin is he, who stands at Arafah, thinking that Allah Almighty might not forgive him."

According to another tradition (transmitted by Ibn Hibban and Al-Hzirim on the authority of Ibn Umar): "Perform circumambulation round this House so much, for this is the most glorious thing you will find in your scrolls on the Day of Judgement, and the greatest deed because of which you will be envied." For this reason, it is desirable to circumambulate the House at the arrival (to Mecca' even before beginning the ceremonies of Hajj and Umrah.


<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">It's very important to circumambulate the House as much as one can</mark>

it is narrated that Ali Ibn Al-Muwaffaq performed Hajj on behalf of the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him". He said: I saw the Messenger of Allah "Allah’s blessing and peace be upon him" in a dream, and he asked me: "O Ibn Al-Muwaffaq! Have you performed Hajj on my behalf?" I answered in the affirmative, he further asked: "*Have you recited Talbiyah on my behalf?" I answered in the affirmative*, thereupon he said: "Then, I will reward you for it on the Day of Judgement: I will take hold of your hand in the standing place and admit you to the Garden while the people will be amidst the disaster of reckoning."

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">One May choose to perform Hajj on the behalf of the Messenger (pbuh) based on the experience of Ibn al-Muwaffaq</mark>

According to Al-Hassan: "He, who dies just after (the conclusion of the month of) Ramadan, or after fighting (in Allah's Cause), or after performing Hajj will have died as a martyr." According to Umar: "It will be forgiven for the pilgrim, as well as for whomever he asks for forgiveness during the months of Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram, Safar, and the first twenty days of Rabie the First.

It is further narrated from him that he said: I performed Hajj one year, and when I finished from all of my ceremonies, I thought of those whose Hajj might not be accepted (by Allah Almighty), and said: "O Lord! I've granted my Hajj, and assigned its reward to such as whose Hajj You have not accepted." In my dream, I saw the Lord Almighty "Exalted be He" Who said to me: "O Ali! Do you show generosity to Me, even though it is I Who has created generosity as well as the generous, and I'm the most Bounteous and the most Munificent of those who are bounteous and munificent, and I'm most fitting for generosity and bounty of all the (creatures in the) worlds? I've granted such as whose Hajj I have not accepted to him whose Hajj I've accepted (to intercede for him and his intercession will be accepted)."

However, the Ka'bah will be mustered in a form of a bridegroom in a procession, with its visitors hanging in its curtains, seeking round until it will be admitted to the Garden, thereupon they will be admitted in its company.

(According to the narration of Al-Hakim) Umar kissed it and said: "I surely know that you are but a stone, which could neither benefit nor cause harm, and had I not seen the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" kissing you, I would not have kissed you." He went on weeping until his moaning became high. He turned to his back and behold! There was Ali (Ibn Abu Talib) to whom he said: "O Abu Al-Hassan! Here tears should be shed, and invocations should receive answer." Ali said: "O Commander of Believers! Of a surety this (stone) benefits as well as it causes harm." He asked: "Why is that?" he said: "When Allah Almighty took covenant from the offspring (of Adam) He wrote a document (to affirm that) which he placed in that Stone, thereupon it bears witness to the loyalty of the faithful believer, and to the ungratefulness to the infidel." It is said: This is the significance which lies the people's statement on their pointing to the Black Stone: "O Allah! It is out of faith in You, trust in Your Book, and loyalty to Your Pledge (I perform this duty)."

***Need to add dua here in Arabic***

and the same is true of any good deed in it which is equal to one hundred thousand good deeds.

It is also said that seven circumambulations are equal to one Umrah, and three Umrahs are equal to one Hajj.

According to a certain tradition: "Allah Almighty casts glance of the people of the earth every night, and the first at whom He looks are those of the Sanctuary, and the first of those of Sanctuary at whom He looks are the people of the Sacred Mosque: He forgives for such as He sees circumambulating the House, such as He sees offering prayer, and such as He sees standing with his face towards the Ka'bah.

One of the saints, to whom the mysteries have been revealed, said: "I saw all the harbours prostrating to Abdan, and I saw Abdan prostrating to Jeddah." It is said that the sun will not set on any day until one of the 'Abdal (substitutes) has performed the circumambulation and that the dawn will not break forth after any night until one of the Awtad has performed it; if this daily habit) comes to an end, it would cause [the Ka'bah] to be removed from the earth, so that people would awaken to find that the Ka'bah had vanished and would find no trace of it. The same will happen if seven years pass without anyone having performed Hajj, and the Qur'an will be removed from the Mushafs, and when morning comes upon the people, the papers would be white and glittering with no single letter on it; and then the Qur'an would be erased from hearts and no word of it would be remembered; and the people would return to the poetry, songs, and tales of the pre-Islamic period of ignorance. Then the Anti-Christ would appear and Jesus "Peace be upon him" would come to kill him. When all this occurs The hour would be like the pregnant woman in travail, waiting for the moment of her delivery.

#### The Excellence Of Living In Mecca "Might Allah Safeguard It"

*Three reasons* why Ulemas dislike living in Mecca:
1. The first is the fear of boredom and the automated dullness of feeling towards it, which might cool down the heat of affection for it.
2. The second is to stimulate longing for the House by leaving it, which would give rise to the motifs of returning to it once again.
3. The third is the fear of committing sins and mistakes therein, for this is, indeed, very dangerous, and incurs upon such as does it the wrath and anger of Allah Almighty, in view of the honour of the place.

*It is said that as well as the good deeds are multiplied therein, the bad deeds also are multiplied.*

According to Ibn Abbas once again: "To commit even as many as seventy sins in (any place such as) Rakyah (a place between Mecca and Ta'if) is much dearer to me than to commit even a single sin in Mecca."

#### The Superiority Of The Honoured Medina To All Cities
The good deeds therein are also multiplied.

The Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" said in this respect (according to the authentic narration on the authority of Abu Hurairah): "A single prayer to be offered in this mosque of mine (in Medina) is better than one thousand prayers to be offered in any mosque else except the Sacred Mosque (in Mecca)."

There comes in rank after Medina the Sacred land (the Farthest Mosque) wherein a single prayer is equal to five hundred prayers in any mosque else other than the Sacred Mosque (of Mecca), and the same is true of all the good deeds.

(According to an unidentified narration on the authority of) Ibn Abbas, The Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" said: "A single prayer to be offered in the mosque of Medina is equal to ten thousand prayers; and a single prayer to be offered in the Farthest Mosque is equal to one thousand prayers; and a single prayer to be offered in the Sacred Mosque (of Mecca) is equal to one hundred thousand prayers."

The Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" said (according to the narration of Ibn Majah and At-Tirmidhi on the authority of Ibn Umar): "If anyone could, let him die in Medina, for none dies therein but that I will be an intercessor for him on the Day of Judgement."

***Imam Ghazali gives an argument in support of visiting the graves of the saints below:***

![[Screen Shot 2025-05-09 at 9.31.09 PM.png]]![[Screen Shot 2025-05-09 at 9.31.35 PM.png]]

A stranger said to Sufwan Ath-Thawri: "I decided to reside in Mecca: what advice should you give me?" he said: "I advise you to do three things: pray not in the first row, accompany not a Quraishi man, and make not public your objects of charity."

### Part Two: The conditions of the obligation of greater pilgrimage; the validity of its pillars; its duties and taboos
The condition for the obligation of Hajj are *two*:
1. The due time of Hajj
2. Being a Muslim

*The first:* the pilgrimage performed by a child is valid, and he could assume Ihram by himself if he has attained the age of discernment; but his guardian could assume Ihram on his behalf if he is still under age, and in this case, he performs with him what he should perform in Hajj, such as the circumambulation (round the House), compassing (Safa and Marwah) round, and all the ceremonies of Hajj.
*The second:* The due time of Hajj lies within the limits of Shawwal, passing by Dhul-Qa'dah, until the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah, up to the rise of dawn of the day of Sacrifice. If one assumes Ihram at any time else, his Ihram should be for Umrah (and not Hajj).

The *conditions* of its effectiveness as the obligatory Hajj are *five*:
1. (The faith in) Islam
2. Freedom (from slavery)
3. The attainment of the age of puberty
4. Sanity
5. (Performing it at its) due time

As for the conditions of the effectiveness of Hajj as supererogatory upon the free adult in Islam, he should have become free from the obligatory Hajj enjoined upon him by Islam (by performing it).

There are *five conditions* for the obligation of Hajj:
1. The attainment of the age of puberty
2. The (faith in) Islam
3. Sanity
4. Freedom (from slavery)
5. The capability (i.e. the availability of financial resources and power)

Capabilities are of *two* kinds:
1. Direct: able to do it by yourself, have the means and clear path to perform it
2. Indirect: let's someone else to it because of disability or death

Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: "I intended to issue a decree of imposing Jizyah (tribute) upon such as does not perform Hajj from amongst those who have the wherewithal to do it."

*Five pillars* of Hajj without which the Hajj is invalid:
1. to assume Ihram
2. to circumambulate the House
3. to compass Safa and Marwah round
4. to stand at Arafah
5. to get the head shaved after it

*Six duties* which can be compensated through sacrifice:
1. the assuming of Ihram from the certain place appointed for the people to put on Ihram
2. the throwing (of Jamrah with pebbles)
3. staying in Arafah until the setting of the sun
4. spending the night in Muzdalifah
5. spending three nights in Mina
6. the farewell circumambulation

There are three kinds of performing Hajj and Umrah:
1. Ifrad (to set out with the sole intention to perform Hajj only)
2. Qiran (to assume Ihram with intention to perform both Umrah and Hajj jointly)
3. Tamattu' (to continue Umrah on to Hajj)

An offering of a sheep is due upon such combines both Umrah and Hajj joindy (*Qiran*) unless he is a Meccan, for in this case, nothing is due upon him, for he does not leave the place fixed to him to assume Ihram, which is Mecca .
If all of those condidons are present in somebody, he then should be in the state of *Tamattu'*, and in this case, an offering of a sheep is due upon him.

To be sure, performing Hajj solely (Ifrad) is the best, followed by continuing Umrah on to Hajj (Tamattu'), and then performing both Umrah and Hajj jointly (Qiran).

There are *six taboos* pertaining to both Hajj and Umrah:
1. The first is to wear a shirt, trousers, footwears (or leather socks) or a turban.
2. The second pertains to perfume. (Offering is due)
3. The third pertains to getting the head shaved or the nails cut off. (Offering is due)
4. The fourth pertains to sexual intercourse. (Offering is due)
5. The fifth pertains to the entries to sexual intercourse, such as the kiss or touch of women, which break the ablution. (Offering is due)
6. The sixth pertain to killing the wild game, i.e. what is lawful to eat, and what is produced from what is lawful or unlawful. (Offering is due for live-stock, not for sea ones)

## CHAPTER TWO: ON THE SEQUENCE OF THE OUTWARD ACTS (OF GREATER PILGRIMAGE) FROM TRAVELING TO RETURNING HOME

Those acts are included in *ten* subsections:
### The First Subsection Starts From The Beginning Of The Setting Out On Journey To Assuming Ihram
This subsection comprises *eight* things:
1. The first pertains to *fund*. He should have sufficient amount of money that is earned through halal means.
2. The second pertains to the *companion*. He should seek a good companion and be helpful to him, if he needs.
3. Pray 2 rakah nafl with Surah Kafirun and Surah Ikhlas. And say the mentioned dua
4. The fourth is that when *he stands at the door* of the house, let him say the mentioned dua. *When he walks* he should say, he should also say the mentioned dua.
5. The fifth pertains to *riding*. Once he rides his mount, let him say the mentioned dua. If one sets right on the *mount*, and it takes its position under him, he should say seven times the mentioned dua.
6. The sixth pertains to the *descent*. It's preferred to do the journey at night. Once he approaches the place of rest, let him say the mentioned dua. Once he descends let him offer a two-rak’ah prayer and then supplicate the mentioned dua
7. The seventh pertains to *guarding*. If he becomes a target of an enemy or a wild animal, whether at night or during the day, let him recite the Holy Verse of the Throne, the (eighteenth Holy Verse of Surah Imran in which Allah says) "Allah bears witness...", in addition to the Surah of Al-Ikhlas, and both Surahs of seeking refuge with Allah, and say the mentioned dua.
8. The eighth is that whenever he comes up a promontory of land on the way, it is desirable to glorify Allah thrice, and say the mentioned dua.
### The Second Subsection: The Proprieties Of Ihram From The Place Fixed For Assuming Hiram To Entering Mecca
They are *five*, and those go as follows:
1. The first is that he should *take bath*, with the intention to be the bathing of Ihram.
2. The second is that he should *leave the sewn dress*, and rather put on the garments of Ihram.
3. The third is that he should wait after putting on his garments until his mount moves. Intention is sufficient for Ihram. But he can also make the mentioned dua. He can further say the mentioned dua
4. The fourth is that once his Ihram is concluded with the above-mentioned wording of Talbiyah, it is desirable to say those words that are mentioned. As of the time of assuming Ihram, all the six taboos which we've mentioned earlier become unlawful for him; so, let him avoid them.
5. The fifth is that it is desirable to renew the wording to Talbiyah (response to Allah's Call) along the duration of Ihram, particularly on the encountering of other companions and the gathering of the people, on every ascending and descending, on every mounting and dismounting, raising his voice with it.

### The Third Subsection: The Proprieties Of Entering Mecca To The Circumambulation
Those are *six*, and they go as follows:
1. The first is to take bath in (the place of) Dhu-Tuwa with the intention to enter Mecca; and there are *nine* desirable (occasions for) bathing set for Hajj:
	1. the first is for assuming Ihram from the Miqat
	2. then for entering Mecca, 
	3. then for offering circumambulation of arrival, 
	4. then for standing at Arafah, then for the stay in Muzdalifah, 
	5. and three for the throwing of the three Jamrahs, and there is no particular bathing for the Jamrah of Aqabah, 
	6. and then one bathing for performing the circumambulation of farewell.
2. The second is that he should say the mentioned, on entering the borders of the Sanctuary, even though outside Mecca.
3. The third is that he should enter Mecca from the side of Abtah, i.e. the side of Kada.
4. The fourth is that once he enters Mecca and reaches Ra's Ar-Radm, and thus his eyes falls upon the House, let him say the mentioned.
5. The fifth is that when he enters the Sacred Mosque, let him enter through the door of Banu Shaibah and say the mentioned. Then, let him raise both his hands and say the mentioned.
6. The sixth is that he (the performer of Hajj) should aim at the Black Stone, to which he should go directly and touch it with his right hand, and kiss it while saying the mentioned.
### The Fourth Subsection: On Circumambulation
When one intends to begin circumambulation, whether that of arrival or anything else, let him observe *six* things:
1. The first is that he should observe the same conditions of prayer, pertaining to the purification from excrements and impurities of body, garment and place, and cover the private parts, for indeed, the circumambulation round the House is a kind of prayer, except that speech in it is made permissible by Allah Almighty (unlike prayer in which speech is not permissible).
2. The second is that once he finished from setting his garment as it should be, let him then make the House on his left, and stand near the Black Stone, and move aside from it a bit enough to make it in front of him, and thus he will be able to receive the whole Stone with the whole of his body at the beginning of his circumambulation.
3. The third is that at the beginning of circumambulation, and before one goes beyond the Black Stone, let him say the mentioned dua. Then, let him exalt and praise Allah Almighty until he reaches the Corner which is in the direction of Iraq, at which let him say the mentioned dua. When he reaches the Comer which is in the direction of Sham, let him say the mentioned dua. When he is in between the Yemenite Corner and the Black Stone, let him say the mentioned dua.
4. The fourth is that one should walk at a quick pace while moving his shoulders =(which is called Ramal) in the first three rounds, and walk at a normal pace in the remaining four.
5. The fifth is that when he completes the seven rounds of circumambulation, let him come to the Multazam, a place which lies in between the (Black) Stone and the door, and it is the place where the invocations receive answer (from Allah Almighty), and then attach himself to the (walls of the) House and hang in the curtains, and let his abdomen stick to the House, and then let him place his right cheek on it, and spread out both his arms and hands on it and say the mentioned dua.
6. The sixth is that when he finishes from that, let him offer a two-rak'ah prayer behind the Station, and recite in the first the Surah of Al-Kafirun, and in the second the Surah of Al-Ikhlas; and this is the two-rak'ah prayer of  circumambulation. After the two-rak'ah prayer of circumambulation, let him supplicate with the mentioned supplication. Then, let him return to the (Black) Stone to touch it and thus conclude his circumambulation.
   This is the way of performing circumambulation, and the duties which should be observed in it, after the conditions of prayer are to complete seven circuits of circumambulation round the whole House; to start with the Black Stone, making the House to his left side; to circumambulate inside the mosque, but outside the House itself, but not on the fountain, nor inside the Hijr; to do the seven rounds continuously and not interruptedly with breaks between them other than what is usual. What is beyond that are but customs and forms.

### The Fifth Subsection: On Compassing Safa And Marwah Round
When one finishes from circumambulation, let him come out of the door of Safa, which lies opposite to the side between the Yemenite Corner and the Stone. When he comes out of that door and reaches the mountain of Safa, let him ascend its grades, as high from its base as is the height of a man.
When one starts from here, let him compass Safa and Marwah round seven times. On his ascending the Safa mount, let him face the Ka'bah and say the mentioned dua.
After that, let him come down and start the compassing, while supplicating the mentioned dua.
Then, let him walk quietly until he reaches the green slope, which is the first portion he meets once he comes down from the mount of Safa which lies at the corner of the Sacred mosque. When there remain only six cubits between him and the opposite of the slope, let him go on walking at a quick pace until he reaches the two green slopes, and returns once again to the normal walking. When he reaches the Marwah mount, let him ascend it in the same way as he has ascended Safa, and then turn with his face to Safa and supplicate with the same supplication (with which he has supplicated on Safa mount). In this way, he will have completed only a single round of compassing.
Performing ablution is desirable but not binding for compassing, unlike the circumambulation.
### The Sixth Subsection: On Standing And What Precedes It
If the performer of Hajj reaches Arafah on the day of Arafah (ninth of Dhul-Hijjah), let him first devote himself to performing the circumambulation of arrival and entering Mecca. But if he reaches many days before that, and performs the circumambulation of arrival, let him remain in the state of Ihram until the seventh day of Dhul-Hijjah. After noon prayer of that day, the imam in Mecca delivers a speech at the Ka'bah, in which he orders the people to get ready to set out to Mina on the day of Tarwiyah (eighth of Dhul-Hijjah), and spend the night there, and then come out therefrom very early to Arafah (on the ninth of Dhul-Hijjah), in order to establish the obligation of standing after the decline of the sun, since the time of standing ranges from the decline of the sun until the rise of the true dawn of the day of Sacrifice.
To walk on foot from the mosque of Abraham "Peace be upon him" to the place of standing (of Arafah) is more excellent and better confirmed. Once he reached Mina, let him say the mentioned dua.
When he reaches Arafah, let him pitch his tent at Namirah, near the mosque, for it is in the same place that the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" pitched his (according to the narration of Muslim on the authority of Jabir).
The imam then combines both Zhuhr (noon) and Asr (afternoon) prayers with a single Adhan and two Iqamahs, in which he shortens the prayer (i.e. reduces each from four to two rak'ahs).
Then, when he (finishes from prayer and) goes to the standing place, let him stand at Arafah, and not at the valley of Urnah. As for the mosque of Abraham "Peace be upon him" its front portion lies in the valley of Urnah, while its back in Arafah. So, if one stands at the front portion of the mosque, his standing will not be effective.
He should not depart from Arafah except after sunset, in order to combine both day and night while being in Arafah; and if it possible for him to stand (at least) an hour on the eighth day (of Dhul-Hijjah), when there is probability of mistake (about the exact day of the emergence of) the new moon, it will be more prudent, therewith one shall become more secure from missing the standing.
On that day, let him wholeheartedly devoted to invocations and supplications, for it is in the like of this very spot (of the land), and among this very assembly (of pilgrims), the answers of invocations and supplications are expected. The best to use in this connection is the supplication that is handed down from the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him", as well as from the early righteous pious men the mentioned dua.
Let him say too the mentioned dua.
Furthermore, let him supplicate so much with the mentioned dua of Al-Khadir "Peace be upon him".
Then, let him invoke with whatever supplication seems to him, and ask for Allah's Forgiveness for himself, his parents and for all of the Muslims and faithful believers, their male and female.
### The Seventh Subsection: The Remaining Acts Of Hajj After Standing
This includes spending the night (at Muzdalifah), slaughtering sacrifice, throwing (of Jamrahs), getting the head shaved, and (Ifadah) circumambulation.
If he reaches Muzdalifah, let him take bath for it, because Muzdalifah is a part of the Sanctuary, which one should enter after bathing; and if he could, let him enter it on foot, for this is much better and closer to showing respect and dignity to the Sanctuary. While being on the way, he should keep rising his voice with the wording of Talbiyah.
When he reaches it let him say the mentioned dua.
Then, let him combine both Maghrib and Isha' prayers in Muzdalifah, at the time of Isha', shortening the prayer, by a single Adhan and two Iqamahs, with no supererogatory prayer to be offered between both. But he might combine the supererogatory prayers of both in addition to Witr prayers after offering both obligatory prayers, beginning with the supererogatory prayer of Maghrib prayers, and then that of Isha' prayer, according to their normal sequence.
Then, let him spend that night at Muzdalifah, and it is a ceremonial lodging. So, he , who comes out of it during the first half of the night and does not spend the night there has to offer a blood-sacrifice;
When it is midnight, one should get ready for setting out, taking pebbles with him, for it (Muzdalifah) has smooth pebbles. Let him then offer the Morning prayer when it is still very dark, and begin proceeding, until when he reaches the Sacred Monument, which is the furthest end of Muzdalifah, let him stop and engage himself in the mentioned dua until it is clear.
Then, before the rising of the sun, let him depart from it until he reaches a place called the valley of Muhassir.
When it is the morning of the day of Sacrifice, let him mix the words of Talbiyah with those of Takhir,; in such a way as to recite Talbiyah once, and glorify (Allah) once until he reaches Mina where there lie the three places of Jamrahs. 
Let him throw the Jamrah of Aqabah after the sun rises as high as a lance.
The proper way to do so is to stand in the face of the Qiblah, but if he stands facing the Jamrah, the will be no harm. Then, let him throw seven pebbles while raising his hand, substituting Takbir for Talbiyah. After throwing each pebble, let him say the mentioned dua.
'Once he finishes from
throwing, let him then stop from reciting Talbiyah and Takbir., barring the Takbir s after every obligatory prayer as of the Zhuhr prayer of the day of Sacrifice until after the Morning prayer of the third day of Tashriq. On that very day, he should not stop for supplication, but rather let him supplicate in his dwelling place.
Takbir goes as mentioned.
Offering a camel as sacrifice is better, then a cow, and then a sheep, and a sheep (for one) is better than to have six join in a camel or a cow; and the sacrifice of a ram is better than a goat.
Then, he should get his head shaved. It is out of the sunnah to face the Qiblah, and start with the front part of his head, and shave the right side until the two prominent bones which go down to die nape, and then shave the remaining of it, while saying the mentioned dua. The women should cut short her hair, and it is desirable for a bald to pass the razor upon his head.
Once he got his head shaved after throwing the Jamrah (of Aqabah), the first desacralizadon will have occurred, and all taboos become lawful for him, barring (the approach of) women and catching (games).
Then, let him set out to Mecca, and perform the circumambulation (of Ifadah) in the same manner we have described earlier, and this circumambulation is one of the pillars of Hajj; *and it is called the circumambulation of visit.* Its due time begins after midnight of the day of Sacrifice, and the best dme to perform it is the day of Sacrifice.
Women remain unlawful for him until he finishes from this circumambulation; and once he performs it, the second desacralizadon will have occurred, and thus sexual intercourse will become lawful for him, since by so doing Ihram will have come to its end;
The way to perform this circumambulation with the two-rak'ah prayer after it is the same as we have described of the circumambulation of arrival.
But it is better to throw (the pebbles) first, then slaughter (his sacrifice), then get his head shaved, then perform circumambulation.
Indeed, there are *four sermons* to be delivered in Hajj: 
1. the sermon of the seventh day (of Dhul-Hijjah), 
2. the sermon of the day of Arafah, 
3. the sermon of the day of Sacrifice, 
4. and the sermon of the day of the first departure; and all of them should be delivered after the decline (of the sun)
When he (the pilgrim) finishes from circumambulation (of visit), let him return to Mina to stay there, and throw (the remaining Jamrahs). Let him spend that night in Mina, which is called the night of settlement.
When it is the morning of the second day of Id (eleventh of Dhul-Hijjah), and the sun passes the meridian, let him take bath for throwing the Jamrah, and goes directly to the first Jamrah next to Arafah mount;
When he goes beyond it, let him turn a bit rightward, and stand facing the Qiblah, and praise Allah Almighty, glorify Allah, and affirm the Allah's Oneness, and supplicate with his heart attentive, and his organs submissive. Let him keep standing with his face towards the direction of the Qiblah as long as is equal to the recitation of the Surah of Al-Baqarah, during which let him engage himself in supplication.
Then, let him proceed further towards the middle Jamrah, and throw it in the same way as he has thrown the former, and stand as long as he has stood in the former. Then, let him proceed further towards the Jamrah of Aqabah, and throw it with seven pebbles, but at this time, he should not engage himself in any business and rather he should return to his dwelling place. He then should spend that night at Mina; *and this night is called the night of the first departure.*
When he offers Zhuhr prayer of the coming day, which is the second day of Tashriq, (i.e. the twelfth of Dhul-Hijjah), let him then throw (the three Jamrahs with) twenty-one pebbles, the same as he had done on the previous day.
When he offers Zhuhr prayer of the coming day, which is the second day of Tashriq, (i.e. the twelfth of Dhul-Hijjah), let him then throw (the three Jamrahs with) twenty-one pebbles, the same as he had done on the previous day. But if he remains until night, it will be then impermissible for him to come out of Mina, and rather he should remain and spend the night there until he throws on the day of the second departure (the three Jamrahs with) twenty-one pebbles, the same as he did on the previous two days.
He has the right to visit the House during the nights which he spends at Mina, on the condition that he should not spend the night but at Mina.
Furthermore, he (the pilgrim) should not be absent from the obligatory prayers (in congregation) with the imam in the mosque of Khaif. 
When he departs from Mina, let him first stay at (the valley of) Muhassab at Mina, where he should offer Asr, Maghrib and Isha' prayers, and have a nap there (according to the narration of Al-Bukhari on the authority of Anas).
### The Eighth Subsection: On The Manner Of Umrah And What Follows It To The Farewell Circumambulation
and the best of places for ihram is Ji'ranah, then At-Tan'im, then Al- Hudaibiyah.
Then, let him state his intention to perform Umrah, go or reciting Talbiyah, and aim directly at the mosque of A'ishah "Allah be pleased with her", in order to offer a two-rak'ah prayer, and invoke for whatever he likes.
After that he should return to Mecca while reciting Talbiyah until he enters the Sacred House.
Once he enters the Sacred House, he should stop from reciting Talbiyah, and engage himself in circumambulation, which should consist of seven rounds, and then compass Safa and Marwah round seven times as we have described earlier. When he finishes from both, let him get his head shaved and thus his Umrah will have been complete.
Moreover, let him drink as much as he could from the water of Zamzam, and it is better to drink by himself, and not through anyone else if it is possible, and let him quench his thirst to the full, while saying the mentioned dua.
### The Ninth Subsection: On The Farewell Circumambulation
When it seems to the pilgrim to return to his homeland, after finishing from his Hajj and Umrah, let him first accomplish his occupations, and prepare his baggage making the last of his occupation to bid farewell to the House by performing a Circumambulation of seven rounds, as previously (described in the other two circumambulations), but without walking at a quick pace (during the first three rounds) nor rearranging his upper garment to uncover the right shoulder. When he finishes from it, let him offer a two-rak'ah prayer behind the Station (of Abraham), drink from the water of Zamzam (as much as he could), go to Multazam, and devote himself to imploration and invocation of Allah Almighty as the mentioned dua.
### The Tenth Subsection: On The Visit To Medina And Its Proprieties
The Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" said (according to the narration of At-Tabarani and Ad-Daraqatni on the authority of Ibn Umar): "He, who visits me after my death seems as if he visited me during my lifetime."
the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" further said (according to the narration of Ibn Abd, Ad-Daraqatni and Ibn Hibban from Malik on the authority of Ibn Umar): "He, who finds a plenty of time (after or before his ceremonies) and even though he does not visit me (in Medina will be regarded to) have desertion towards me."
the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" also said (according to the narration of At-Tabarani on the authority of Ibn Umar): "He, who comes to visit me, and he is mainly concerned with visiting me, it is incumbent upon Allah Almighty to accept my intercession for him (on the Day of Judgement)."
Once his sight falls upon the walls and trees of Medina, let him say mentioned dua.
Then, let him aim at the mosque to enter, *and offer a two-rak'ah prayer by the side of the pulpit,* making the pole of the pulpit alongside his right shoulder, and face the pillar beside which the box lies, in such a way as to have the circle which is on the wall of the Qiblah of the mosque in between his eyes.
Let him endeavour to pray in the original (area of the) mosque before the inclusion of the additional area in the mosque.
Then, let him come to the grave of the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" and stand by its face, i.e. to turn his back to the Qiblah and face the wall of the grave, as long as nearly four cubits far from the pillar which is in the angle of the wall of the grave, and make the chandelier over his head.
It is not out of the sunnah to touch the wall of the grave, nor to kiss it: on the contrary, to stand at a short distance from it is closer to respect and veneration. Let him stand and say the mentioned dua.
If he is recommended to convey the salutation (to the Prophet) of anyone on his behalf, let him say the mentioned dua.
Then, let him return and stand by the side of the head of the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him", between the grave and the pillar nowadays, and face the Qiblah, in order to praise and exalt AJlah Almighty, and invoke so much Allah's Prayer and Blessing upon the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him", and then say the mentioned dua.
Then, let him go to the meadow and offer a two-rak'ah prayer, and invoke as much as he could, depending upon the statement of the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" (according to what is unanimously narrated on the authority of both Abu Hurairah and Abdullah Ibn Zaid): *"There is, in between my grave and pulpit, one of the meadows of the Garden; and my pulpit lies on my Fount-lake."*
*Let him invoke at the pulpit;* and it is desirable to place his hand on the lower knot (of the pulpit) on which the Messenger of Allaf "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" used to put his hand during his sermons.
It is desirable for him to go to (the mountain of) Uhud on Thursday, and visit the graves of the martyrs.
Therefore, it is desirable for him to come out everyday to Baqi', after paying salutation to the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" in order to visit the grave of Uthman "Allah be pleased with him" and the grave of Al-Hassan Ibn Ali "Allah be pleased with both".
It is desirable for him to go to the mosque of Quba' every Saturday, and offer prayer in it.
Let him come to the well of Aris which lies near the mosque and perform ablution and drink from its water, for it is said that the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" spat in it.
Let him further go to the mosque of the Conquest, which lies on the Trench, in addition to all the mosques and sites in Medina. It is said that all mosques and sites of Medina are thirty, and they are known to its inhabitants.
Those are seven wells, (and one should visit them and offer ablution and drink from their water) seeking cure, and the bless of the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him".
Then, if he finishes from his jobs, and intends to come out of Medina, it is desirable for him to go to the honoured grave (of the Prophet) and repeat the supplication of the visit as previously (mentioned earlier) and then bid farewell to the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" and ask Allah Almighty to grant him the gift of returning to it once again, and invoke Allah for safety in his journey, and offer a two-rak'ah prayer in the lesser meadow, in which the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" used to stand before the closet was added to the mosque. When he comes out, let him come out with his left foot followed by the right and say the mentioned dua.
### A Chapter On The Traditions Of Returning From Journey
Whenever the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him", (according to what is unanimously narrated on the authority of Ibn Umar) returned from a holy battle, Hajj or Umrah, he would glorify Allah thrice at the ascent of every promontory and say the mentioned dua.
If he approaches his city, let him move his riding mount, and say the mentioned dua.
## CHAPTER THREE: ON THE DETAILS OF PROPRIETIES AND INWARD WORKS
Those are *ten*, and they go as follows:
1. The first is that the expenses should be lawful, and one is free from such of trades as occupies the heart and disband his concern, in order that his attention would be wholeheartedly devoted to Allah Almighty, and the heart assured and diverted to the celebration of (the Praises of) Allah Almighty, and sanctification of His ceremonies.
2. The second is that he should not assist the enemies of Allah Almighty, through handing over the toll to them, and those are the keepers off the Sacred Mosque, such as the governors of Mecca and the desert Arabs who lie in wait of the people on the way (to Mecca).
3. The third is to have abundance of provisions and liberty of spending and giving willingly and gladly, with neither parsimony nor extravagancy, but to adhere to moderation. To be sure, to give provision (in charity) on the way to Hajj is to spend in the Cause of Allah Almighty; *and a single Dirham is multiplied by seven hundred.* the Messenger of Allah "Allah's blessing and peace be upon him" said (according to the narration of Ahmad on the authority of Jabir): "The Hajj which is accepted (by Allah Almighty) has no reward other than the Garden." *It was said: "What does make Hajj acceptable (by Allah Almighty)?" He said: "It is to speak with good words, and give food (to the poo and indigent)."*
4. The fourth is to leave obscenity, wickedness and wrangling as expressed in the Qur'an.
5. The fifth is that he should perform Hajj on foot if it is within the reach of his capacity, for this is better. The desirability of walking on foot during offering the ceremonies, and from Mecca to the place of standing and to Mina is better confirmed than to do it on the way to Hajj.
6. The sixth is that he should not ride but a sack, and avoid the litter, unless he feels afraid he would not sit firm on the sack for a legal excuse. 
7. The seventh is that he should be of a shabby appearance, disheveled, covered with dust, not given so much to adornment, nor inclined to the means and ways of ostentation, lest he might be enrolled among the group of the arrogant luxurious, and thus excluded from the party of the weak indigent righteous select. Specifically avoid wearing *red*.
8. The eighth is that he should be lenient to the riding mount in such a way as not to overload it with what is beyond its capacity, and the litter is beyond its capacity; and sleeping on it causes harm to it, and overburdens it.
9. The ninth is that he should draw near (unto Allah Almighty) through an offering of a blood-sacrifice, even though it is not obligatory upon him.
10. The tenth is that he should be well-pleased with such of expenses as he has spent and such of sacrificial animals as he has offered, and accept (with satisfaction) such of loss or calamity in property or camels as has affected him, in case there is any;
### The Exposition Of The Internal Works, And The Point Of Making Sincere The Intention, And The Way Of Considering The Honoured Shrines, And The Way Of Reflecting Them, And Celebrating Their Mysteries And Significances, From The Beginning To The End Of Hajj
*As for understanding*, it should be known to you that there is no way to Allah Almighty barring that of refraining from desires and abstaining from pleasures and delights, and rather restricting oneself to such of them as is necessary, and to devote himself wholeheartedly to Allah Almighty in all of his states of motion and stillness. 
For this reason, The Messenger of Allah “Allah’s blessing and peace be upon him” said in Hajj particularly: "I'm responding to Your Call with a greater pilgrimage in truth, in devotion and in bondage." He did not say so in prayer, nor in any religious service other (than Hajj).
If the wisdom of Allah Almighty decrees that the salvation of the people should be joined with doing things which contradict their dispositions and desires, having their reins led by the law, in such a way that they do their deeds in accordance to the ways of submission and obedience, and pursuant to the requirements of bondage and slavery, then, *such of deeds as to whose significance the minds could not be guided will come to be more consummate to purify the souls*, and divert them from the requirements of the dispositions, and the ethics to the requirements of bondage and slavery.
*As for longing*, it is incited after understanding, and authentication of the fact that this is the House of Allah Almighty, which He has placed on the example of the castles of kings, and that its visitor is a visitor of Allah Almighty, and that such as intends to visit the House in the world is worthy of having (the reward of) his visit wasted, and thus the real purpose of his visit will be achieved for him in its appointed time.
*Verily, longing to meet Allah Almighty prompts it inevitably to its causes, seeing that the lover always has longing to anything that relates to the object of his love.*
*As for his resolution* (to visit the House and perform Hajj), let him know first that with his resolution and decision, he is going to depart from his family and homeland, to forsake his desires and pleasures, turning to the visit of the House of Allah Almighty.
Moreover, let him make his resolution sincere to the Countenance of Allah Almighty, far from the flaws of showing off for the purpose of being heard or seen of men.
Let him be certain of the fact that nothing from his deed and intention would be accepted unless it is sincere and true, putting in consideration that the most wicked thing is to aim at the visit of the House and Sanctuary of Allah Almighty, while his real purpose and intention are for another thing.
*As for severing any connections* that might hinder him from performing Hajj, it is to restitute all injustices, and turn in sincere and true repentance tc Allah Almighty, which is to give up all sins.
However, every injustice has i connection (with him), and every connection as such is like a present creditor clinging to his neck, calling him: "Where are you going? Do you aim at (the visit of) the House of the Kings of all kings, even though you are indulging in implementing His Commands, dealing with Him slightly, and neglectful of Him in this residence of you? Do you not feel shy of going to him in the form of a disobedient slave lest He might reject you with failure?
If you do not do so, you will receive nothing from your journey but the trouble and tire on the one hand, and the rejection and failure on the other hand.
*As for provisions*, he should seek it from a lawful source, and if he feels he is eager to take much of it, and to keep what will remain with him along his journey, which does not change nor putrefy before achieving his purpose, let him remember that the journey to the hereafter is much longer than this journey (to Hajj), *and that his real provision should be piety, and such as he thinks to be his provisions should remain behind him and betrays him at his death,* and thus it will not be kept with him, just as the fresh food, which putrefies at the first station of the journey, with the result that he will be, at the time of his need, in confusion and perplexity, in the state of neediness, with no way for salvation.
*As for the riding mount*, if he brings it, let him thank Allah from the depth of his heart for He has made subject to him the mounts, in order to carry (his things) on his behalf, and relieve him of trouble and difficulty.
Let him consider whether his journey on that riding mount would be valid for his provisions during his journey on the other vehicle to the hereafter, for indeed, how close it is to him.
*As for buying both garments of Ihram*, let him remember the shroud in which he will be shrouded: he will be dressed in it, whereas he is going to put on both garments of Ihram once he becomes close to the House of Allah Almighty.
*As for setting out of the country*, let him know at that moment that he is going to depart from his family and homeland, and rather he is turning to Allah Almighty on a journey, which is not similar to any of those journeys belonging to this world.
Let him also bring in his heart the hope of arrival and acceptance, not because of his works of setting out on journey and leaving his family and property, but because of his confidence of the Bounty of Allah Almighty, and in expectation of achieving His Promise for such as visit His House.
*As for his coming through the desert*, until he reaches the place fixed for assuming Ihram, and seeing those difficulties, let (the pilgrim) remember in connection with it the period from his coming out of this world by death to the appointed time on the Day of Judgement, and such of terrors and requirements as lie between them.
*As for putting on Ihram and reciting Talbiyah* from the place fixed for assuming Ihram, let him know that its significance is to respond to the Call of Allah Almighty. Verily, the time at which you recite Talbiyah is the beginning of implementing the command (of Allah), and it is the place of risk.
*As for entering Mecca*, let him remember that by so doing, he has entered the Sanctuary of Allah Almighty safely hoping that through such entering, he might be secure from the Punishment of Allah Almighty.
